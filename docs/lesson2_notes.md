## 🎯 Goal of Lesson 1.4 Fine-Tuning vs RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

Understand how to **customize LLMs** for your use case:

* Either by **fine-tuning** the model
* Or using **RAG** (feeding external knowledge to the model at runtime)

---

## 🔍 Why You Need This

### Problem:

LLMs like GPT don’t know your **organization’s policies, project reports, documents**, etc.

### Solution:

You can fix this in two ways:

| Option          | Idea                                       | When to Use It                     |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| **Fine-tuning** | Retrain the model with custom examples     | You need new behaviors or format   |
| **RAG**         | Pull answers from external data via search | You need accurate, up-to-date data |

## ⚙️ What is Fine-Tuning?

Fine-tuning = Training the model again on your **own examples** to teach it something new or specific.

### 🔸 Example Use Case:

You want GPT to always answer in the tone of your company’s support team:

* You collect chat logs (Q & A)
* You fine-tune the base GPT model with those
* The new model learns your brand’s voice

### ✅ Pros:

* Results feel integrated
* Fast at inference time
* Tailored behavior

### ❌ Cons:

* Takes time, cost
* Hard to update
* Not good for dynamic knowledge

## 🔍 What is RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)?

> “RAG” means: **Search first, then ask the LLM.**

LLMs don't store new info — but you can plug in an **external database or file** and let it fetch relevant info before responding.

---

### 🔄 How RAG Works:

1. 🧾 You upload documents (PDFs, docs, web pages)
2. 🔍 User asks a question
3. 📥 A search system (like a vector DB) retrieves top relevant chunks
4. 🧠 The retrieved chunks are added to the prompt
5. 🤖 The LLM generates a response using those chunks

---

### 🔸 Example Use Case:

> “Summarize the company’s leave policy”
> → Pulls from your company HR policy PDF
> → Sends that to GPT
> → GPT answers using that content

## 🧠 Analogy

| Method      | Analogy                                   |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Fine-tuning | Teaching someone new facts permanently    |
| RAG         | Letting them read a file before answering |
